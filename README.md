##   Program designed to manage a political party  

The program was created for the political party in need of a system of managing it, to keep a register of government and self-government activities that it supports or protects against.  
The party is managed by the Team of Leaders who are its members.  
Member can propose actions and vote for or against them.  
You become a party member through active participation in her life. After one year of inactivity, understood as the lack of calls to the program functions authorized by a given person, the party member's righst are lost, and such account is permanently frozen (the member can not perform any action, but all information about him is further stored and reported). This rule applies to all party members, including leaders.
